# How to Setup and Run the application

## Install dependencies

- Check out or clone the repository.
- Go inside `fedex` folder and run the below command.

```
npm install
```

- The above command should install the dependencies required to run the application.

## Run application

✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

- I would recommend to install nx globally, execute the below command.

```
npm install --global nx@latest
```

- Next to run the application, execute the command below:

```
nx serve
```

If you intend to skip above step, run the application using below command.

```
npx nx serve
```

- Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/

## Create production build 
```
npx nx build
```
The distribution would be created under `dist` folder.

## Running unit tests

You can run all the tests parallely using the below command:

```
npx nx test
```

or 

```
npm run test
```

The above command would run tests from the workspace and creates covergae folder in the respective directories.

## Architecture Decisions

- Scaffolding application is a very first for any project. I wanted to have a setup that has inbuilt support for jest, supports for libs creation, support for eslint configured automatically. And thinking about modularity and sharing code across libraries and app, I wanted to start with Nx workspace. Offcourse there are many more super duper advantegous.

- For UI, I chose to work with Angular Material components because its very easy to start consuming dumb components and build our application. Offcourse every organization should/would have there own design system adhereing to there UI principles.

- For CSS, I have implemeted a custom small library that has some general purpose utilities that can export classes and that can be used across. This maintains code uniformity and single source of truth for css. This implementation is very much similar to idea of tachyons, tailwind css etc..

- For my own learning, I chose to develop SignUp feature using two ways via Reactive Form Control and via Template Driven using `signals`. However, `Signals Implementaion` was purely for knowledge update/understanding and not intended to assignment. Both features are lazily loaded.

- Standalone components are preferred in this Impl and you would notice most of the components are standalone.

- The overall communication between `app vs libs` should be lean and simple. `Separation of concenrns` is what i really care about and you would notice there is abstraction for almost everywhere.

- The application layer should be very thin by delegating all other heavy stuff to libraries/modules. In this way we can co-locate/organize libraries per use-case and shared across application. The intention is to convert each feature library to Angular Element or even a Micro Frontend at a later point of time.

## Unit tests

Although Angular has huge support for writing unit tests with there testing package, I some how do not see much developer experience when writing tests with Angular way. I enjoy/prefer to write tests using `jest` combined with the power of `Angular testing library`. As i said i love abstractions `ATL` is a great way of looking at writing tests.

All the unit/integration tests that you see are written using `jest` offcourse all mockings as well.

## What did i not consider ?

- The fullname of the user can also be stored at a central place for example `user-session.service.ts` file. At this point `fullname` resides at component level. The bridge between component-service is just missing if in case that was expected.
- i18n, for now its all hard coded texts.
- Email Validation, is something hard to convince with Implementation without any rules. It is vast, let me be honest. Offcourse, it depends on to what extent we need to support the usecase and I understand how important is email validation. At this point I chose very simple/mediocre solution :-)
- Cypress tests
- Although I strive for having to cover all scenarios using unit tests positive, negative cases, I believe I did not over looked into any component by missing it!
- The coverage report can be found at `coverage` folder at root of the application. However I did not go deep into it.
